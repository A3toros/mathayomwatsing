# Canvas Zoom Reset Fix

## Problem Analysis

**Issue**: Canvas zoom resets to 39% (0.39) after every drawing action, making it impossible to maintain a desired zoom level while drawing.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` that initializes the canvas was being triggered on every re-render, which happens after each drawing action because the `lines` state changes. This caused the zoom to be reset to the initial calculated value (0.39) every time.

**Evidence from Logs**:
```
DrawingTestStudent.jsx:726 üé® DrawingTestStudent - Canvas size set: 1536 x 2048
DrawingTestStudent.jsx:727 üé® DrawingTestStudent - Viewport size: 600 x 800
DrawingTestStudent.jsx:728 üé® DrawingTestStudent - Initial zoom: 0.39
```

This pattern repeated after every drawing action, showing the zoom was being reset.

## Solution Implemented

### **1. Added Zoom Initialization Tracking**
```javascript
const zoomInitializedRef = useRef(false);
```

### **2. Modified Canvas Initialization Logic**
```javascript
// Only set initial zoom if it hasn't been initialized yet
if (!zoomInitializedRef.current) {
  const initialZoomX = viewportWidth / actualCanvasWidth;   // 600/1536 = 0.39
  const initialZoomY = viewportHeight / actualCanvasHeight; // 800/2048 = 0.39
  const initialZoom = Math.min(initialZoomX, initialZoomY, 1.0);
  
  setZoom(initialZoom);
  zoomInitializedRef.current = true; // Mark as initialized
  
  console.log('üé® DrawingTestStudent - Initial zoom:', initialZoom.toFixed(2));
} else {
  console.log('üé® DrawingTestStudent - Preserving user zoom:', zoom.toFixed(2));
}
```

### **3. Updated All Zoom Change Handlers**
Added `zoomInitializedRef.current = true;` to all user interaction handlers:

- **Wheel zoom**: `handleWheel` function
- **Two-finger gestures**: `handleTouchMove` function  
- **Zoom buttons**: Zoom in/out button handlers
- **Reset button**: Reset zoom button handler

## How It Works

### **Initial Load**:
1. Canvas loads with initial zoom of 0.39 (39%)
2. `zoomInitializedRef.current` is set to `true`
3. Future re-renders preserve the current zoom level

### **User Interaction**:
1. User zooms in/out using wheel, gestures, or buttons
2. `zoomInitializedRef.current` is set to `true`
3. Future re-renders preserve the user's chosen zoom level

### **Drawing Actions**:
1. User draws on canvas
2. `lines` state changes, triggering re-render
3. `useEffect` runs but skips zoom reset because `zoomInitializedRef.current` is `true`
4. Canvas maintains current zoom level

## Benefits

### **User Experience**:
- ‚úÖ Zoom level persists during drawing
- ‚úÖ No more frustrating zoom resets
- ‚úÖ Smooth drawing experience
- ‚úÖ Professional behavior like other drawing apps

### **Technical**:
- ‚úÖ Minimal code changes
- ‚úÖ No performance impact
- ‚úÖ Maintains all existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable solution

## Testing Scenarios

### **Test Cases**:
1. **Initial Load**: Canvas starts at 39% zoom ‚úÖ
2. **User Zooms**: Zoom level persists during drawing ‚úÖ
3. **Drawing Actions**: No zoom reset after drawing ‚úÖ
4. **Multiple Drawings**: Zoom maintained across multiple drawing actions ‚úÖ
5. **Zoom Controls**: All zoom controls work correctly ‚úÖ
6. **Two-Finger Gestures**: Mobile zoom/pan works correctly ‚úÖ

## Code Changes Summary

### **Files Modified**:
- `src/components/test/DrawingTestStudent.jsx`

### **Changes Made**:
1. Added `zoomInitializedRef` to track zoom initialization
2. Modified canvas initialization `useEffect` to check initialization status
3. Updated all zoom change handlers to mark initialization
4. Added console logging for debugging

### **Lines Changed**:
- Added 1 new ref declaration
- Modified 1 `useEffect` function
- Updated 5 zoom change handlers
- Added 5 initialization markers

## Result

The canvas now maintains the user's chosen zoom level throughout their drawing session, providing a much better user experience. Users can zoom in to work on details or zoom out for overview without losing their zoom level when they draw.

**Before**: Zoom reset to 39% after every drawing action ‚ùå
**After**: Zoom level persists during drawing ‚úÖ
