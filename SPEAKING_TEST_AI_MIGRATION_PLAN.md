- **Current Scoring**: Generous scoring system
- **Current Feedback**: Basic transcription and simple scoring
- **Issues**: 
  - Too generous with scores
  - Limited analytical capabilities
  - Basic feedback quality
  - No detailed improvement suggestions

### Current Flow
1. Audio uploaded to Supabase
2. Audio processed by current AI model
3. Basic transcription generated
4. Simple scoring applied
5. Basic feedback provided

## Migration Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Enhanced Scoring**: Implement sophisticated language proficiency analysis
2. **Detailed Feedback**: Provide specific improvement suggestions
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Utilize GPT-4o Mini's analytical capabilities

### Scoring Criteria (5-Category System)
- **Grammar (25%)**: Sentence structure, verb tenses, subject-verb agreement
- **Vocabulary (20%)**: Word choice, variety, appropriateness for level
- **Pronunciation (15%)**: Based on transcription accuracy and clarity
- **Fluency (20%)**: Speaking pace, natural pauses, flow
- **Content (20%)**: How well student addressed the prompt topic

### Difficulty Level Scoring (6 CEFR Levels):
- **A1 (Beginner)**: Very lenient, basic vocabulary, simple sentences
- **A2 (Elementary)**: Lenient, everyday vocabulary, present/past tenses
- **B1 (Intermediate)**: Moderate, varied vocabulary, complex sentences
- **B2 (Upper-Intermediate)**: Strict, advanced vocabulary, sophisticated structures
- **C1 (Advanced)**: Very strict, nuanced vocabulary, complex discourse
- **C2 (Proficiency)**: Expert level, native-like fluency and accuracy

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. **Add Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Update Dependencies**
   ```json
   {
     "openai": "^4.0.0"
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: API Integration Setup
1. **Create New Service File**: `src/services/openaiService.js`
   ```javascript
   import OpenAI from "openai";

   const client = new OpenAI({
     baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
     apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
   });

   export const analyzeSpeakingTest = async (transcript, testPrompt, studentLevel) => {
     // Implementation details in Phase 3
   };
   ```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Analysis Implementation

#### 3.1 Comprehensive Analysis Function
```javascript
async function analyzeTranscript(transcript, prompt, difficultyLevel) {
  const analysisPrompt = `
You are an expert ESL speaking test evaluator. Analyze this student's response:

PROMPT: "${prompt}"
STUDENT RESPONSE: "${transcript}"
STUDENT LEVEL: ${difficultyLevel} (${getCEFRDescription(difficultyLevel)})

IMPORTANT: Evaluate the student based on their CURRENT LEVEL (${difficultyLevel}). 
- For A1 students: Expect basic vocabulary, simple present tense, basic sentence structure
- For A2 students: Expect everyday vocabulary, present/past tenses, simple complex sentences
- For B1 students: Expect varied vocabulary, conditional sentences, some complex structures
- For B2 students: Expect advanced vocabulary, sophisticated grammar, complex discourse
- For C1 students: Expect nuanced vocabulary, complex grammar, native-like structures
- For C2 students: Expect expert-level vocabulary, perfect grammar, native-like fluency

Evaluate on these 5 categories and return JSON:
{
  "grammar_score": 0-25,        // Grammar accuracy appropriate for ${difficultyLevel} level
  "vocabulary_score": 0-20,     // Word choice and variety appropriate for ${difficultyLevel} level
  "pronunciation_score": 0-15,  // Clarity and accuracy appropriate for ${difficultyLevel} level
  "fluency_score": 0-20,        // Pace, pauses, flow appropriate for ${difficultyLevel} level
  "content_score": 0-20,        // How well they addressed the prompt (appropriate for ${difficultyLevel} level)
  "grammar_mistakes": number,   // Count of grammar errors for ${difficultyLevel} level
  "vocabulary_mistakes": number, // Count of vocabulary issues for ${difficultyLevel} level
  "word_count": number,         // Total words spoken
  "feedback": "string"          // Teacher-style feedback message appropriate for ${difficultyLevel} level
}

SCORING GUIDELINES FOR ${difficultyLevel}:
${getScoringGuidelines(difficultyLevel)}
`;

  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: analysisPrompt }],
    response_format: { type: "json_object" }
  });

  return JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

#### 3.2 5-Category Score Calculation
```javascript
function calculateScore(analysis) {
  const { 
    grammar_score, 
    vocabulary_score, 
    pronunciation_score, 
    fluency_score, 
    content_score 
  } = analysis;
  
  // Sum all category scores (already weighted by GPT-4o Mini)
  const totalScore = grammar_score + vocabulary_score + pronunciation_score + 
                    fluency_score + content_score;
  
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, Math.round(totalScore)));
}
```

#### 3.3 Database Integration
```javascript
// In process-speaking-audio-ai.js
// Get the question details including difficulty level and prompt
const questionData = await sql`
  SELECT prompt, difficulty_level 
  FROM speaking_test_questions 
  WHERE id = ${questionId}
`;

const { prompt, difficulty_level } = questionData[0];

// Pass the CEFR level to GPT-4o Mini for level-appropriate evaluation
const analysis = await analyzeTranscript(transcript, prompt, difficulty_level);
const score = calculateScore(analysis);

const resultData = {
  // Use existing columns
  grammar_mistakes: analysis.grammar_mistakes,
  vocabulary_mistakes: analysis.vocabulary_mistakes,
  word_count: analysis.word_count,
  overall_score: score,
  
  // Add new columns for detailed scoring
  feedback: analysis.feedback,
  ai_model_used: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini',
  
  // Store individual category scores (if we add these columns)
  grammar_score: analysis.grammar_score,
  vocabulary_score: analysis.vocabulary_score,
  pronunciation_score: analysis.pronunciation_score,
  fluency_score: analysis.fluency_score,
  content_score: analysis.content_score
};
```
