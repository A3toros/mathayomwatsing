-- TEACHER ACTIVE TESTS VIEW
-- Comprehensive view for get-teacher-active-tests.js function
-- Combines all test types with their active assignments

-- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Follow the EXACT original Neon SQL structure and logic
-- Do NOT modify the data structure or add/remove fields without checking original
