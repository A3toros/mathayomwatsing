## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### New Components:
1. **`WordMatchingCreator.jsx`** - Teacher interface for creating tests
2. **`WordMatchingStudent.jsx`** - Student interface for taking tests
3. **`WordMatchingPage.jsx`** - Page wrapper for student tests

### Key Features:
- **Teacher Creator:**
  - Radio button selection for interaction type (drag vs arrow)
  - Numbered input fields for word pairs
  - Real-time preview
  - Validation and error handling

- **Student Interface:**
  - Drag & drop functionality using Konva.js
  - Arrow drawing mode with click-to-connect
  - Progress saving and restoration
  - Anti-cheating monitoring
  - Confirmation modals for actions

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Updated Files:
1. **`shared-index.jsx`** - Added word matching to test types
2. **`TeacherTests.jsx`** - Added word matching to test creation flow
3. **`StudentTests.jsx`** - Added word matching to student test list
4. **`TestContext.jsx`** - Added word matching support
5. **`database_schema_new.sql`** - Added new tables

### Test Management:
- Word matching appears in teacher test type selection
- Uses `matching-words.png` icon
- Follows same assignment flow as other tests
- Integrated with class assignment system

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Interaction Types:
1. **Drag Mode:** Students drag words from left list to right list
2. **Arrow Mode:** Students click to connect words with arrows

### Scoring System:
- Randomizes word display order for security
- Maps display indices to correct pairs
- Calculates score based on correct matches
- Supports both interaction types

### Caching & Progress:
- Auto-saves progress every 30 seconds
- Restores progress on page reload
- Clears progress after submission
- Caches test results immediately

### Security Features:
- Anti-cheating monitoring
- Visibility change tracking
- Secure test completion keys
- Student-specific data isolation

## 🚀 Usage Flow

### For Teachers:
1. Select "Word Matching" from test types
2. Choose interaction type (drag or arrow)
3. Enter word pairs with numbered inputs
4. Set optional passing score
5. Assign to classes as usual

### For Students:
1. Click "Start Test" on word matching tests
2. Match words using chosen interaction method
3. Progress is auto-saved
4. Submit when complete
5. View results immediately

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile-optimized layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive word containers
- Adaptive spacing and sizing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- React with hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Konva.js for canvas interactions
- React Router for navigation
- Custom UI components (Button, Card, Modal, etc.)

### State Management:
- useReducer for complex creator state
- Context API for global test state
- Local storage for progress persistence
- Cache utilities for data management

## ✅ Testing Status

- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All components properly exported
- ✅ Database schema validated
- ✅ API functions implemented
- ✅ Frontend integration complete

## 🎉 Ready for Use

The word matching test feature is now fully implemented and ready for production use. Teachers can create word matching tests with either drag-and-drop or arrow-drawing interactions, and students can take these tests with full progress saving and anti-cheating protection.

The implementation follows the same patterns as existing test types, ensuring consistency and maintainability within the codebase.
